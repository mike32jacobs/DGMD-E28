	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<h2>This is my first assignment for DGMD E-28: Developing Single Page Web Applications.</h2>
	<div><img src="/DGMD-E28/assignment1/goodmorning.jpeg"></div>
	<p>My name is Michael Jacobs. I am from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XAoiHDxe69iFuP2k8" target="_blank">Chillicothe,
			MO</a>, but I have lived in New Hampshire for the last 22 years.
		I am a math teacher at Kingswood High School in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rg3fWDXT6ghfZNpk8"
			target="_blank">Wolfeboro,
			NH.</a>
	<div>
		<p>Most of my web development skills have come from creating websites for teaching. I originally created a site
			for my students using <a href="https://www.softpress.com/freeway-pro/" target="_blank">freeway</a>.</p>
		<p>Then in 2011 I started using learning manangement systems, so I no longer had to create my own sites. I did -
			however - need to understand html in order make my courses look the way that I wanted them to look. Last
			year, I decided to enroll in the extension school to see if I could get some more coding skills. This will
			be my last class before I earn my graduate certificate.</p>

	<p>Wolfeboro is a small town on Lake Winnipesaukee. My favorite restaurant in town changes frequently, but currently
		it is <a href="https://garwoodsrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Garwoods Restarant & Pub.</a></p>
