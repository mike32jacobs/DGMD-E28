	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>My name is Michael Jacobs. I am from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XAoiHDxe69iFuP2k8" target="_blank">Chillicothe,
			MO</a>, but I have lived in New Hampshire for the last 22 years.
		I am a math teacher at Kingswood High School in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rg3fWDXT6ghfZNpk8"

		<h2>Web Development Experience</h2>

		<p>Most of my web development skills have come from creating websites for teaching. I originally created a site
			for my students using <a href="https://www.softpress.com/freeway-pro/" target="_blank">freeway</a>.</p>
		<p>Then in 2011 I started using learning manangement systems, so I no longer had to create my own sites. I did -
			however - need to understand html in order make my courses look the way that I wanted them to look. Last
			year, I decided to enroll in the extension school to see if I could get some more coding skills. This will
			be my last class before I earn my graduate certificate.</p>
